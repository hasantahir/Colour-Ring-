# Colour-Ring-

Hi.
Any help is really appreciated.

This project uses the Adafruit TCS34725 RGB sensor to measure the ambient colour and light intensity.
The Arduino code translates these measurements to three specific outputs. These three outputs are
one, two and three vibrations of the motor which correspond directly to the detection of red, green and
blue. This system is activated by pressing in the pushbutton, hence allowing the battery life of the device
to be extended. The main processor can be any microprocessor that has an I2C communication. Due to
the fact that this product is designed to fit into a ring the smallest microprocessor such as the Arduino
Pro mini or the Exen mini is recommended.

Possible uses would be to know if ones clothes match.

We are putting alot of effort into distribution throughout africa.
We are based in Johannesburg South Africa
