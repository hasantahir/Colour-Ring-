# Colour-Ring-

Hi.
Any help is really appricated.

The Colour-Ring allows a visually impaired person to gauge the colour of an item. With the use of a colour sensor.
The sensor will map the value of Red, Green and Blue and translate them to a small vibration motor.
This will pulse out the values of the various colours.

Possible uses would be to know if ones clothes match.

We are putting alot of effort into distribution throughout africa.
We are based in Johannesburg South Africa
